@@ Real-Time Live Streaming of Sensory Data on Cloud @@
```

This is a scenario in which the sensory data from ESP32 will be uploading data to AWS IoT Core and further it stores in dynamodb and can create notifications using Simple Notification Service. Using AWS MQTT Test Client, we can be able to control the devices with the help of MQTT protocol.
